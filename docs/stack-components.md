Kafka bin directory: */opt/kafka/bin*

Zookeeper log file: /opt/zookeeper/tmp/zookeeper.out  

## Ports

You can control(open or shut down) ports by **[Security Group Setting](https://support.websoft9.com/docs/faq/zh/tech-instance.html)** of your Cloud Server whether the port can be accessed from Internet.

You can run the cmd `netstat -tunlp` to list all used ports, and we list the following most useful ports for you:

| Name | Number | Use |  Necessity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TCP | 9092 | Kafka | Optional |
| TCP | 2181 | Zookeeper | Optional |
| TCP | 9091 | CMAK | Optional |


## Version

You can see the version from product page of Marketplace. However, after being deployed to your server, the components will be automatically updated, resulting in a certain change in the version number. Therefore, the exact version number should be viewed by running the command on the server:

```shell
# Linux Version
lsb_release -a

# Java  Version
java -version

# Kafka version
ls /opt/kafka/libs | grep kafka_
```
